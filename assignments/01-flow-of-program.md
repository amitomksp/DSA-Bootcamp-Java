## Create flowchart and pseudocode for the following:

1. Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.
2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.

3. class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
4. Scanner sc=new Scanner (System.in);
5. int number1=sc.nextInt();
6. int number2=sc.nextInt();
7. int sum =number1+number2;
8. return sum;}}


9. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.
10. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
11. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all.
